# üìä COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis with NLP

**Course**: CMPT 353 - Computational Data Science  
**Skills**: Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning  
**Tools**: Python, NLTK, VADER, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes how people's emotions changed on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic using advanced natural language processing techniques. The study combines sentiment analysis with time series analysis to understand emotional trends and their correlation with major pandemic events.

## üìà Key Achievements

- **Large-Scale Analysis**: Processed and analyzed 1M+ tweets from the COVID-19 dataset
- **Advanced NLP**: Implemented VADER sentiment analysis for emotion quantification
- **Machine Learning**: Applied multiple classification algorithms (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks)
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracked sentiment evolution throughout pandemic phases
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Created detailed charts showing emotional trends over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Processing

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned tweets using NLTK and custom text processing pipelines
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted temporal, linguistic, and contextual features
- **Data Quality**: Handled missing values and noise in social media data

### Sentiment Analysis

- **VADER Integration**: Applied VADER sentiment analyzer for emotion scoring
- **Multi-class Classification**: Implemented sentiment prediction models
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluated Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network approaches

### Visualization & Analysis

- **Time Series Plots**: Created comprehensive visualizations of sentiment trends
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied correlation analysis between sentiment and pandemic events
- **Report Generation**: Produced detailed analysis report with insights

## üìä Results & Insights

- **Sentiment Trends**: Identified significant shifts in public sentiment correlating with major pandemic events
- **Model Performance**: Achieved strong classification accuracy across multiple sentiment categories
- **Temporal Patterns**: Discovered cyclical patterns in emotional responses to pandemic news
- **Policy Impact**: Correlated sentiment changes with government policy announcements
